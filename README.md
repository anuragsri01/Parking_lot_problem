# Parking_lot_problem
This repository gives an overview of how we can design a basic parking lot in Python. It creates parking lot with given number of slots. The cars follow Greedy approach while being parked in the slots.

## Parking_Lot
Design a parking lot using Python.

## Dependencies

You just need Python. The code is compatible with Python2 as well as Python3. Visit the link https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install Python. 

## Description

This repository gives an overview of how we can design a basic parking lot in Python. It creates parking lot with given number of slots. The cars follow Greedy approach while being parked in the slots.

parking_program.py script can use the following commands -

1. `create_parking_lot` - Given n number of slots, create a parking lot
2. `park` - Parks a vehicle with given registration number and of the driver of certain age in the nearest empty slot possible. If there are no more empty slots available, it shows a message "Sorry, parking lot is full".
3. `status` - Prints the slot number, registration number and age of the driver of the parked vehicles.
4. `leave` - Removes vehicle from slot number x
5. There are few query functions to retrieve slot number from registration number of car, get registration numbers of cars with the driver's age.

ParkingLot.py can be run through shell or through file containing test cases. An example file `inp.txt` has been provided in repo.


## Setup

To create your own ParkingLot - 

1. Clone the repository

2. Run `python parking_program.py` to run without input test case file. This opens a shell where you can write your commands like -

  
3. To run with a file execute 'python parking_program.py -f inp.txt'. You can modify the test cases.
